# AI Asset Research App

A lightweight research app to analyze publicly traded assets (stocks/ETFs) with a focus on:

- A single **stock page** (price history, key metrics, notes)
- **Compare/screener** view (2–5 tickers)
- Optional add-ons: watchlists, news, simple valuation, export

## Goal / Deadline

Target: **Feb 11** (MVP).

## MVP Scope (draft)

- Input: ticker symbol(s)
- Output: chart + metrics + comparison table
- Notes: user-entered notes per ticker

## Tech (TBD)

We’ll pick the stack next (likely Next.js for fastest demo).

## Development

TBD
